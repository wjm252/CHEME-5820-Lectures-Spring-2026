    "## Contrastive Divergence Training\n",
    "Training an RBM follows the same principle as training a general Boltzmann machine: maximize the log-likelihood of the training data. The gradient of the log-likelihood with respect to the weights involves two expectations—one over the data distribution and one over the model distribution. Computing the model expectation requires sampling from the equilibrium distribution, which is computationally expensive.\n",

    "In practice, CD-1 ($k=1$) works well for most applications and is the most commonly used variant. Larger values of $k$ provide better gradient approximations but increase computational cost. Typical learning rates are $\\eta \\in [0.001, 0.1]$, and the number of hidden units $m$ is often chosen to be comparable to or larger than the number of visible units $n$ to ensure sufficient representational capacity.\n",
