    "## Feedforward Neural Networks\n",
    "Consider the network shown above. The network has three layers: an input layer (five nodes), a hidden layer (twelve nodes), and an output layer (three nodes). \n",
    "\n",
    "* __Input layer__: The input layer receives raw data, with each node representing one feature of the input vector. It does not perform computation—its role is to pass input values to the next layer.\n",
    "*  __Hidden layer__: The hidden layer performs computations on the input data. Each node takes the input vector $\\mathbf{x}$ and applies a linear transformation followed by a non-linear activation function. The output of each node passes to the next layer. The number of nodes and layers can vary depending on the task complexity. Networks with multiple hidden layers are called _deep neural networks_.\n",
    "* __Output layer__: The output layer produces the network output $\\mathbf{y} = (y_{1},y_{2},\\dots,y_{k})$ where $\\mathbf{y}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{k}$. Each node takes output from the hidden layer and applies a linear transformation followed by an activation function. For multi-class classification, the output can be interpreted as probabilities for each class using softmax.\n",

    "Suppose we have a feedforward neural network with $L$ layers. The network has $d_{in}$ input nodes (layer 0), $i=1,2,\\dots, L-1$ hidden layers where hidden layer $i$ has $m_{i}$ nodes, and the output layer $L$ has $d_{out}$ nodes. Each hidden layer is fully connected to the previous and subsequent layers (no connections within a layer and no self-connections). Information flows from input to output, forming a feedforward structure.\n",

    "#### Inputs, Outputs, and Parameters\n",
    "* __Inputs and outputs__: Let $\\mathbf{x} = (x_{1},x_{2},\\dots,x_{d_{in}},1)^{\\top}$ be the _augmented_ input vector, where the extra `1` allows the bias term to be included in the weight vector. Let $\\mathbf{z}^{(i)} = (z^{(i)}_{1},z^{(i)}_{2},\\dots,z^{(i)}_{m_{i}})^{\\top}$ be the output vector of layer $i$. Finally, let $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}= (y_{1},y_{2},\\dots,y_{d_{out}})^{\\top}$ be the predicted output vector.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Strengths\n",
    "* __Universal Approximation__: [FNNs are universal approximators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_approximation_theorem), meaning they can approximate any continuous function to arbitrary precision given sufficient hidden units and training data.\n",
    "* __Flexibility__: FNNs can be applied to classification, regression, and generative modeling tasks. They can work with different data types including images, text, and time series. \n",
    "* __Non-linearity__: Non-linear activation functions enable FNNs to learn complex non-linear relationships that linear models cannot capture. They can classify non-linearly separable datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weaknesses\n",
    "* __Overfitting__: FNNs can overfit training data, especially when the model is complex or training data is limited. Regularization techniques (dropout, L1/L2 regularization, early stopping) can mitigate this issue.\n",
    "* __Computational Cost__: Training FNNs can be computationally expensive for large datasets or deep networks. Modern hardware and software frameworks help, but efficient implementation requires expertise.\n",
    "* __Interpretability__: FNNs are often considered __black box__ models, making it difficult to interpret predictions. This is a disadvantage in applications where interpretability is required (e.g., healthcare, finance). Techniques such as [LIME](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04938) and [SHAP](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07874) can help improve interpretability.\n",

Stochastic gradient descent and mini-batch variants provide computationally efficient approaches to parameter optimization.\n",

However, they are prone to overfitting, computationally expensive to train, and often lack interpretability.\n",
