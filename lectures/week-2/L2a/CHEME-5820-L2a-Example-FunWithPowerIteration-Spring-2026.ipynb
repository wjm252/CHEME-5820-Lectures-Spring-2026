    "## Background: What is a stoichiometric matrix?\n",
    "Suppose we have a set of chemical (or biochemical) reactions $\\mathcal{R}$ involving the chemical species (metabolite) set $\\mathcal{M}$. Then, the stoichiometric matrix is a $\\mathbf{S}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{|\\mathcal{M}|\\times|\\mathcal{R}|}$ matrix that holds the stoichiometric coefficients $\\sigma_{ij}\\in\\mathbf{S}$ such that:\n",
    "* $\\sigma_{ij}>0$: Chemical species (metabolite) $i$ is _produced_ by reaction $j$. Species $i$ is a product of reaction $j$.\n",
    "* $\\sigma_{ij} = 0$: Chemical species (metabolite) $i$ is not connected with reaction $j$\n",
    "* $\\sigma_{ij}<0$: Chemical species (metabolite) $i$ is _consumed_ by reaction $j$. Species $i$ is a reactant of reaction $j$.\n",

    "> * **Covariance matrices enable eigendecomposition of non-square matrices:** By computing the covariance matrix of the stoichiometric matrix columns, we transform a non-square matrix into a square, symmetric matrix suitable for eigendecomposition.\n",
    "> * **Power iteration converges to the dominant eigenpair:** The iterative approach provides a computationally efficient alternative to direct methods, particularly useful for large sparse matrices encountered in genome-scale metabolic networks.\n",
