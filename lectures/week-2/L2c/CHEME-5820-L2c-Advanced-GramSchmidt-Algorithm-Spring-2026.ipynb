    "# Classical and Modified Gram-Schmidt\n",
    "Before we can implement [QR iteration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_algorithm), we need a QR-decompostion method which returns the $\\mathbf{Q}$ and $\\mathbf{R}$ matrices. \n",
    "\n",
    "The [QR decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_decomposition) can be computed using a variety of approaches, including a handy technique called [the Gram–Schmidt algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram%E2%80%93Schmidt_process). In principle, Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization generates a set of mutually orthogonal vectors $\\mathbf{q}_{1},\\mathbf{q}_{2},\\dots, \\mathbf{q}_{n}$ starting from a set of linearly independent vectors $\\mathbf{x}_{1},\\mathbf{x}_{2},\\dots,\\mathbf{x}_{n}$ \n",

    "> __When to use Classical vs. Modified Gram-Schmidt__:  \n",
    "> * __Classical Gram-Schmidt__: Simpler to understand conceptually and slightly faster computationally, but can suffer from numerical instability in finite-precision arithmetic. Use when: working with well-conditioned matrices; column vectors are far from being linearly dependent; exact arithmetic is available (symbolic computation).  \n",
    "> * __Modified Gram-Schmidt__: More numerically stable in practice, producing more orthogonal vectors when working with finite-precision arithmetic. Use when: numerical stability is critical; working with ill-conditioned matrices; column vectors are nearly linearly dependent; this is the __recommended approach__ for practical implementations.\n",

    "__Initialization__: Given a matrix $\\mathbf{A} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times m}$ with linearly independent columns $\\mathbf{a}_{1}, \\mathbf{a}_{2}, \\ldots, \\mathbf{a}_{m}$, we initialize an orthogonal matrix $\\mathbf{Q} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times m}$ and an upper triangular matrix $\\mathbf{R} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m\\times m}$ as zero matrices of the appropriate sizes. Let $n, m$ denote the dimensions of $\\mathbf{A}$, and set a tolerance $\\epsilon > 0$ for detecting linear dependence (typically $\\epsilon = 10^{-10}$).\n",

    "> __Parameter selection rules of thumb__:  \n",
    "> * __Tolerance__ $\\epsilon$: Used to detect near-linear dependence in the columns. A good starting point is $\\epsilon = 10^{-10}$ for double-precision arithmetic. If $r_{j,j} < \\epsilon$, the columns are likely linear dependent.  \n",
    "> * __Matrix dimensions__: The algorithm requires $n \\geq m$ (at least as many rows as columns). If $m > n$, the columns cannot all be linearly independent.  \n",
    "> * __Numerical stability__: Classical Gram-Schmidt can lose orthogonality when: the condition number of $\\mathbf{A}$ is large ($\\kappa(\\mathbf{A}) > 10^{8}$ for double precision); columns are nearly parallel (inner products close to 1); in these cases, prefer Modified Gram-Schmidt or use reorthogonalization\n",
