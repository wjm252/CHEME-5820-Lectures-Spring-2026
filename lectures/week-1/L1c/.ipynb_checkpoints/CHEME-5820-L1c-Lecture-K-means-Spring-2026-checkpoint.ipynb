    "## Background: What is unsupervised learning and clustering?\n",
    "Unsupervised learning is a branch of machine learning that deals with unlabeled data. Its goal is to discover hidden patterns and structures without predefined target variables. One of the most common tasks in unsupervised learning is clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __What is clustering?__\n",
    "> \n",
    "> __Clustering__ is an unsupervised machine learning technique that organizes data points into groups, or clusters, based on their similarities without prior knowledge of the group memberships. This method is widely used for exploratory data analysis, enabling the discovery of patterns and relationships within complex datasets.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> * __Hierarchical clustering__ is an unsupervised machine learning technique that organizes data points into a tree-like structure of nested clusters. This allows for the identification of relationships and patterns within the dataset. This method can be implemented using two main approaches: agglomerative, which merges individual points into larger clusters, and divisive, which splits a single cluster into smaller ones.\n",
    "> * __Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN)__ is a density-based clustering algorithm that groups closely packed data points while effectively identifying outliers, making it particularly useful for datasets with noise and clusters of arbitrary shapes. By defining clusters as dense regions separated by areas of lower density, DBSCAN can efficiently discover meaningful patterns in complex data distributions.\n",
    "> * __Gaussian mixture models (GMMs)__ are probabilistic models that represent a dataset as a combination of multiple Gaussian distributions, each characterized by its mean and covariance. This allows for the identification of underlying subpopulations within the data. This approach is useful in clustering and density estimation, providing a flexible framework for modeling complex, multimodal distributions.\n",

    "## K-means clustering (Lloyd's algorithm)\n",
    "The [K-means algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering), originally developed by [Lloyd in the 1950s but not published until 1982](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1056489), is a foundational approach to unsupervised clustering. Suppose we have a dataset $\\mathcal{D}=\\left\\{\\mathbf{x}_{1},\\mathbf{x}_{2},\\dots,\\mathbf{x}_{n}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\right\\}$ where each $\\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m}$ is an $m$-dimensional feature vector.\n",

The algorithm groups data points (feature vectors) $\\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathcal{D}$ into clusters $\\mathcal{C} = \\left\\{\\mathcal{c}_{1},\\dots,\\mathcal{c}_{K}\\right\\}$ based on proximity to cluster centroids.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __How does K-means measure similarity?__\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Clustering algorithms group data based on **similarity**, a measure of how alike two data points are. K-means operationalizes similarity through **distance metrics**: points that are closer together in feature space are considered more similar. The algorithm minimizes within-cluster distances, which equivalently maximizes within-cluster similarity.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> K-means uses the **squared [Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance)** $d(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y})^{2} = \\left\\|\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{y}\\right\\|_{2}^{2}$ for computational efficiency (avoids computing square roots). Points are assigned to the centroid they are closest to (smallest distance = highest similarity). Other distance metrics can also be used, though squared Euclidean distance is standard for K-means.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Important**: Features with larger scales (e.g., income in thousands of dollars) dominate distance calculations compared to smaller-scale features (e.g., age in years). Standardizing features to zero mean and unit variance before clustering ensures all features contribute equally to similarity measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notation $\\|\\cdot\\|_{2}$ represents the Euclidean norm, a specific type of vector norm. Understanding vector norms more broadly clarifies how different distance metrics measure magnitude.\n",
    "\n",

    "> A **norm** is a function that assigns a non-negative length or size to vectors in a vector space. For a vector $\\mathbf{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m}$, the **p-norm** (also called $\\ell^{p}$ norm) is defined as:\n",

    "> * **Euclidean norm** ($p=2$): $\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|_{2} = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{m} v_i^2}$ measures straight-line distance (used in K-means)\n",

    "> The distance between two vectors $\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\mathbf{y}$ is computed as $d(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y}) = \\|\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{y}\\|_{p}$. K-means uses the squared Euclidean distance $\\|\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{y}\\|_{2}^{2}$ for computational efficiency (avoids the square root).\n",

The objective function $J = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left\\|\\mathbf{x}_{i} - \\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{c_{i}}\\right\\|_{2}^{2}$ decreases monotonically because: (1) the assignment step assigns each point to its nearest centroid, which cannot increase $J$, and (2) the update step computes centroids as means, which minimizes the sum of squared distances for the current assignments. Since there are finitely many possible clusterings and $J$ is non-increasing, convergence is guaranteed in finite iterations, typically within 10–50 iterations.\n",

    "> * __Computational complexity__: The complexity is $O(nKm \\cdot t)$, where $t$ is iterations, $n$ is data points, and $m$ is dimensionality. For large datasets (typically $n > 100{,}000$), mini-batch K-means reduces per-iteration cost to $O(Bm)$ where $B$ is the mini-batch size (commonly $B = 100$ to $1000$), trading some accuracy for speed. Mini-batch K-means randomly samples a subset of points for each iteration, making it practical for datasets too large to fit in memory.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Feature scaling and data preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "Before applying K-means, it is important to consider feature scaling. Since the algorithm uses Euclidean distance, features with larger scales (e.g., income in dollars) will dominate distance calculations compared to features with smaller scales (e.g., age in years). A common approach is to standardize each feature to zero mean and unit variance:\n",

    "- **Elbow method**: Plot the within-cluster sum of squares (the objective function $J$) versus $K$. Look for an \"elbow\" or bend point where further increases in $K$ yield diminishing improvements in $J$. This method is visual and intuitive but subjective.\n",
    "- **Silhouette method**: Measure how similar each point is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. Higher silhouette scores indicate better-defined clusters. This method is more objective than the elbow method.\n",
    "- **Calinski-Harabasz index**: Computes the ratio of between-cluster to within-cluster variance. Higher values suggest more distinct clustering and more separation.\n",
    "\n",

Domain knowledge about the problem may also inform the choice of $K$, especially when multiple methods suggest different values. For example, marketing teams analyzing customer segmentation often prefer $K = 3$ to $5$ segments for actionable strategies, while genomic studies might use $K$ values corresponding to known biological subtypes or populations.\n",
