    "## Data and Notation\n",
    "Let $X = \\{x_1,\\ldots,x_n\\}$ be a finite set of data points in $\\mathbb{R}^m$. A clustering is a partition $\\mathcal{C} = \\{C_1,\\ldots,C_k\\}$ of $X$ into $k$ nonempty, disjoint clusters. The Calinski-Harabasz index measures clustering quality through variance decomposition. We begin by formalizing these foundational concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Definition (Clustering partition).** A clustering partition $\\mathcal{C} = \\{C_1,\\ldots,C_k\\}$ satisfies: (i) each cluster $C_j$ is a nonempty subset of $X$, (ii) the clusters are pairwise disjoint: $C_i \\cap C_j = \\emptyset$ for $i \\ne j$, and (iii) the union covers $X$: $\\bigcup_{j=1}^k C_j = X$.\n",

    "Each cluster is characterized by its centroid, which represents the central tendency of the cluster members.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Definition (Cluster centroid).** For cluster $C_j \\in \\mathcal{C}$, the centroid $\\mu_j \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$ is the arithmetic mean of all points in the cluster:\n",

    "## Properties and Computational Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Interpretation and range.__\n",
    "> \n",
    "> The Calinski-Harabasz index takes values in $(0, \\infty)$ with larger values indicating better clustering. Unlike normalized metrics that range from $-1$ to $1$, the CHI is unbounded above. The index compares clusterings through variance ratios: high values indicate that between-cluster separation dominates within-cluster dispersion.\n",
    "\n",
    "These interpretive properties extend to the data requirements and computational characteristics of the metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Data requirements and computational complexity.__\n",
    "> \n",
    "> The metric requires only the data points and cluster assignments, with no need for labeled data or ground truth. Computing the index requires calculating cluster centroids and summing squared distances, yielding $O(nm)$ computational complexity where $n$ is the number of points and $m$ is the dimensionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The index formulation requires careful handling of edge cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Special cases and edge conditions.__\n",
    "> \n",
    "> For $k=1$ (single cluster), the between-cluster sum of squares $\\text{SSB}=0$ and the normalization factor $(k-1)=0$, making the index undefined. For $k=n$ (each point is its own cluster), the within-cluster sum of squares $\\text{SSW}=0$, causing division by zero. The index is therefore defined only for $1 < k < n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Calinski-Harabasz index exhibits computational advantages but also systematic preferences in how it evaluates clustering quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Euclidean geometry and convexity bias.__\n",
    "> \n",
    "> The index relies on squared Euclidean distances through the $\\ell_2$ norm. This formulation favors spherical or convex cluster shapes and may undervalue valid non-convex structures. The variance decomposition assumes that distances to centroids provide meaningful measures of cluster quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond geometric assumptions, the index offers practical advantages for cluster validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Cluster number selection.__\n",
    "> \n",
    "> The Calinski-Harabasz index provides a principled approach to selecting the number of clusters. By computing $\\text{CHI}$ for different values of $k$ and selecting the $k$ that maximizes the index, practitioners can identify natural groupings in the data. This approach works particularly well when clusters are well-separated and roughly spherical.\n",

    "\n",
    "> __Key takeaways:__\n",
    "> \n",
    "> 1. **The index balances two variance components:** The Calinski-Harabasz index $\\text{CHI} = \\frac{\\text{SSB}}{\\text{SSW}} \\times \\frac{n - k}{k - 1}$ compares between-cluster scatter to within-cluster scatter, normalized by degrees of freedom.\n",
