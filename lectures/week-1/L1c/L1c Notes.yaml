L1c Notes


Lloyds Algorithm
    - K-Means algorithm is foundational approach to unsupervised clustering. 
        - Suppose dataset D made up on n vectors
    - K-Means partitions data points into K distinct groups by minimizing the within-cluster sum of squared distances
        - Algorithm groups data points (vectors) x in D into clusters C = {c1,...,cK}

Vector Norms
    - Manhattan Norm (p=1) --> measures distance as sum of absolute differences
    - Euclidean norm (p=2) --> measures straight line distance
    - Maximum norm (p=∞) --> measures distance as largest component difference

Lloyds K-means clustering
    - we dont know kmax --> make it up
    - while loop until condition converges
    - May have to run multiple times --> will always converge

1. Assignment step
    - Assign each data point to the cluster with the nearest centroid
    - For each data point xi in D, find the cluster cj whose centroid μj is closest to xi based on chosen distance metric (e.g., Euclidean distance)
    - Assign xi to cluster cj
