    "# Activity: Estimating a Logistic Regression Binary Classifier using Gradient Descent\n",
    "In this activity, we will implement a logistic regression binary classifier using gradient descent. Logistic regression is a statistical method for predicting binary outcomes based on one or more predictor variables. It is widely used in various fields, including machine learning, medical research, and social sciences.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Learning Objectives:__\n",
    ">\n",
    "> After completing this activity, students will be able to: \n",
    "> * **Derive logistic regression from statistical mechanics:** We develop the logistic regression model by viewing binary class labels as states in a Boltzmann distribution and derive the cross-entropy loss function. This approach connects statistical mechanics concepts with machine learning classification problems.\n",
    "> * **Implement gradient descent optimization:** We use gradient descent to minimize the cross-entropy loss function and find optimal classifier parameters. The implementation uses finite difference approximations to compute gradients and iteratively updates parameters until convergence.\n",
    "> * **Train and evaluate a binary classifier:** We train a logistic regression model on the banknote authentication dataset and evaluate its performance using a confusion matrix. The model learns to distinguish genuine from forged banknotes based on wavelet-transformed image features.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "In this activity, we built a logistic regression binary classifier from first principles using gradient descent optimization. We derived the cross-entropy loss function from a Boltzmann distribution, implemented the gradient descent algorithm with finite difference gradient approximations, and trained the model on the banknote authentication dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Key Takeaways:__\n",
    "> \n",
    "> * **Cross-entropy loss minimization:** We minimized the negative log-likelihood function (cross-entropy loss) to find optimal classifier parameters. The gradient descent algorithm iteratively updated parameters using a learning rate of 0.005 until convergence.\n",
    "> * **Training and testing data split:** We randomly partitioned the banknote dataset into 80% training data and 20% testing data. This split allowed us to evaluate how well the trained model generalizes to unseen examples.\n",
    "> * **Performance evaluation with confusion matrix:** We computed a confusion matrix to assess the classifier's performance on the test set. The matrix shows true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives for genuine versus forged banknote classifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The logistic regression model successfully learned to classify banknotes based on wavelet-transformed image features, demonstrating the effectiveness of gradient descent for parameter estimation in binary classification problems.\n",
