    "* __What are kernel functions__? A kernel function $k:\\mathbb{R}^{\\star}\\times\\mathbb{R}^{\\star}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ takes a pair of vectors $\\mathbf{v}_i\\in\\mathbb{R}^{\\star}$ and $\\mathbf{v}_j\\in\\mathbb{R}^{\\star}$ as arguments, \n",

    "* __Common kernel functions__: Common kernel functions include the linear kernel, which is the dot product between two vectors $k(\\mathbf{z}_i, \\mathbf{z}_j) = \\mathbf{z}_i^{\\top}\\mathbf{z}_j$, the polynomial kernel is defined as: $k_{d}(\\mathbf{z}_i, \\mathbf{z}_j) = (1+\\mathbf{z}_i^{\\top}\\mathbf{z}_j)^d$ and the radial basis function (RBF) kernel $k_{\\gamma}(\\mathbf{z}_i, \\mathbf{z}_j) = \\exp(-\\gamma \\lVert\\mathbf{z}_i - \\mathbf{z}_j\\rVert_{2}^2)$ where $\\gamma>0$ is a scaling factor, and $\\lVert\\cdot\\rVert^{2}_{2}$ is the squared Euclidean norm\n",
    "* __What do kernel functions do__? Kernel functions are similarity measures, i.e., they quantify the similarity between pairs of points in _some_ high-dimensional space. For example, we could use a kernel function to measure the similarity between augmented feature vectors $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}_{i}$ and $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}_{j}$, or we could construct higher dimensional versions of the features, for example, by including $x^{2}, x^{3}, \\dots,$ terms in addition the original features. Increasing the dimension is [sometimes referred to as feature engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_engineering), i.e., transforming raw data into a more effective set of features.\n",

    "> __Experiment__: If two tickers are similar industries, e.g., `NVDA` and `AMD`, or `GS` and `JPM`, then they should have a high similarity score. However, if tickers can be anti-correlated, e.g., `SPY` or `QQQ` and `GLD`. Anticorrelated firms will have low similarity scores."
