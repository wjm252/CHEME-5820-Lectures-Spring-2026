    "In this lecture, we explore the GloVe (Global Vectors) model, an approach for learning word embeddings from global word-word co-occurrence statistics in a corpus. Unlike prediction-based methods like CBOW, GloVe leverages count-based statistics to capture semantic relationships, providing a bridge between statistical methods (like PMI) and neural embeddings.\n",

    "## What is GloVe?\n",
    "GloVe (Global Vectors) is a count-based model that learns word embeddings by factorizing a global word-word co-occurrence matrix. Unlike local context methods (like CBOW) that predict nearby words, GloVe captures the overall statistical structure of word relationships across the entire corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Why GloVe?__\n",
    ">\n",
    "> GloVe combines the advantages of count-based methods (like PMI, which capture global statistics) with the efficiency of neural embeddings. It addresses PMI's limitations by learning low-dimensional vectors that preserve linear relationships, enabling semantic arithmetic like $\\text{vector}(\\text{King}) - \\text{vector}(\\text{Man}) + \\text{vector}(\\text{Woman}) \\approx \\text{vector}(\\text{Queen})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "GloVe assigns each vocabulary item $i$ a vector $\\mathbf{w}_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ so that the geometry of the vector space encodes co-occurrence structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Two Vectors per Word__\n",
    ">\n",
    "> GloVe learns two vectors per word and combines them after training:\n",
    "> * __Word vectors:__ $\\mathbf{w}_{i}$ is used when word $i$ is the center word in the context window.\n",
    "> * __Context vectors:__ $\\tilde{\\mathbf{w}}_{i}$ is used when word $i$ appears as a context word.\n",
    "> * __Final Embedding:__ Use $\\mathbf{w}_{i} + \\tilde{\\mathbf{w}}_{i}$ (or their average) as the embedding for word $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This asymmetry accounts for the different roles of words in co-occurrence pairs Next, we define the co-occurrence counts that form the foundation of the model.\n",

    "## From Co-occurrence Counts to Meaning\n",
    "The core idea of GloVe is to model the relationship between words through their co-occurrence probabilities. Let $X_{ij}$ denote the weighted number of times word $j$ occurs in the context window of word $i$. We define the total co-occurrence count for word $i$ as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "X_{i} = \\sum_{k} X_{ik}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "and the conditional probability as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P_{ij} = \\frac{X_{ij}}{X_{i}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "so that $P_{ij}$ is the empirical probability that word $j$ appears near word $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Interpreting Ratios__\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The key insight is to examine ratios of these probabilities:\n",
    "> * __Large ratio:__ If $P_{ik}/P_{jk}$ is large, context word $k$ is much more associated with center word $i$ than with $j$.\n",
    "> * __Ratio near 1:__ If $P_{ik}/P_{jk} \\approx 1$, word $k$ is related to $i$ and $j$ in similar ways.\n",
    "> * __Small ratio:__ If $P_{ik}/P_{jk}$ is small, word $k$ is more associated with $j$ than $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for words $i=\\text{ice}$ and $j=\\text{steam}$, the ratio $P_{\\text{solid}} / P_{\\text{gas}}$ would be large because \"solid\" co-occurs more with \"ice\" than \"steam\".\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Numerical Example__\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Consider a small corpus with words: \"cat\", \"dog\", \"food\", \"sleep\". Suppose we observe these co-occurrence counts within a context window:\n",
    "> * $X_{\\text{cat},\\text{food}} = 15$, $X_{\\text{cat},\\text{sleep}} = 8$\n",
    "> * $X_{\\text{dog},\\text{food}} = 12$, $X_{\\text{dog},\\text{sleep}} = 2$\n",
    "> * Total counts: $X_{\\text{cat}} = 23$, $X_{\\text{dog}} = 14$\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The conditional probabilities are:\n",
    "> * $P_{\\text{cat},\\text{food}} = 15/23 \\approx 0.65$\n",
    "> * $P_{\\text{cat},\\text{sleep}} = 8/23 \\approx 0.35$\n",
    "> * $P_{\\text{dog},\\text{food}} = 12/14 \\approx 0.86$\n",
    "> * $P_{\\text{dog},\\text{sleep}} = 2/14 \\approx 0.14$\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The ratio $P_{\\text{food},\\text{cat}} / P_{\\text{food},\\text{dog}} = 0.65/0.86 \\approx 0.76$ (close to 1, indicating similar association), while $P_{\\text{sleep},\\text{cat}} / P_{\\text{sleep},\\text{dog}} = 0.35/0.14 \\approx 2.5$ (large ratio, indicating \"sleep\" is more associated with \"cat\" than \"dog\").\n",
    "\n",
    "We now connect these statistical insights to the vector learning objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building the Co-occurrence Matrix\n",
    "The co-occurrence matrix $X$ is built by scanning the corpus with a sliding context window and accumulating weighted counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Construction Steps__\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * __Step 1 (Vocabulary):__ Tokenize the corpus, clean the text, and select a vocabulary of the most frequent words.\n",
    "> * __Step 2 (Context Window):__ Choose a symmetric context window of size $c$ around each center word.\n",
    "> * __Step 3 (Weighted Counts):__ For each center word $i$ and context word $j$ within the window, add a weight (e.g., $1/d$ where $d$ is the distance) to $X_{ij}$. This gives higher weight to closer words.\n",
    "> * __Asymmetry Note:__ $X_{ij}$ may not be symmetric because the roles of word and context differ, though in practice it often is made symmetric for simplicity.\n",

For example, a co-occurrence count of 50 gets weight $\\min(1, (50/100)^{3/4}) = \\min(1, 0.56) = 0.56$, while a count of 200 gets weight 1.\n",
