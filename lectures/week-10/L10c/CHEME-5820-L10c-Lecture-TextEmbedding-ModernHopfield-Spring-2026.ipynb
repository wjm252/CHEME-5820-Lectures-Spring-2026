    "# L10c: Enegry-Based Models for Word Embeddings\n",
    "In this lecture, we explore Energy-Based Models (EBMs) for learning word embeddings. EBMs provide a flexible framework for modeling relationships between words by associating them with energy values.\n",
    "This approach relies on our earlier discussion of mondern Hopfield networks.\n",
